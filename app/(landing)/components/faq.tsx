        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The time it takes to compress a video depends on several factors:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-4 mt-2">
          <li className="text-gray-700">
            <b>Video size:</b> Larger videos naturally take longer to compress.
          </li>
          <li className="text-gray-700">
            <b>Desired compression level:</b> Aiming for a smaller file size
            typically requires more processing time.
          </li>
          <li className="text-gray-700">
            <b>Hardware capabilities:</b> Faster processors and more RAM will
            accelerate the compression process.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-2">
          Therefore, it&apos;s difficult to provide a definitive answer without
          knowing these specifics. However, compression time can range from{" "}
          <b>seconds for short clips</b> on powerful computers to{" "}
          <b>hours for large video files</b> on slower machines.
